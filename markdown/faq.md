## font

[Iosevka Slab](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), a free and open-source programming typeface. I originally found it while looking for nice-looking condensed monospace fonts to use in my text editor, but I quickly fell in love with it and use it all over the place now, even in places where proportional fonts are normally used. I originally used the standard version, but slab-serif has really grown on me.

I find it easy to read compared to many other fonts, although I don't have any empirical evidence that it improves accessibility. Also, not having to worry about liscensing is nice. I actually compiled this customized version of the font from the source code, mainly because I like how this 3 looks.

## website

I made this website with WebAssembly and [Yew](https://yew.rs/), mostly just as an excuse to learn Rust, HTML, and CSS. It's hosted on Github Pages, which is why I'm using a hash
router instead of a normal browser router. If you're wondering why it looks so blocky and chunky, I just think it looks cute.
