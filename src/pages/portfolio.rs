                    gameplay mechanics of Stylish Action games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Devil May Cry with the intuitive controls and perspective of FPS games.
                    The game also takes a lot of inspiration from quake-like FPS games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2, bearing similar expressive movement mechanics and
                    integrating them into the combo system of the game." } </p>
