## Vesper

Vesper is the working title of a game project I'm working on. It's a Stylish Action FPS game that combines the accessible yet deep and expressive
gameplay mechanics of Stylish Action games like Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Devil May Cry with the intuitive controls and perspective of FPS games.
The game also takes a lot of inspiration from quake-like FPS games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2, bearing similar expressive movement mechanics and
integrating them into the combo system of the game.

## ANNIHILATRIX (Albums)

ANNIHILATRIX is a pair of albums based on the story of a game pitch that's hanging around my head. They're both avaliable on Bandcamp!
